							MACHINE LEARNING

lisp programming language.. was developed by the father of ai
ai's subclasses are deep learning and machine learning 

the types of machine learning are::

1) Supervised learning                 2) Unsupervised learning             3)Reinforcement learning
-> Predicting class                    -> Data driven                       -> Learn from mistakes
-> Output is given as labels           -> Output is not given
                                       -> Identify clusters

1) Supervised learning::

-> the goal is to predict the output (Y) and takes an input (X)
-> here we split the values.. we take the function (f)
-> we split the f for training data too 

i) Types of supervised learning::
1. Classification 
2. Regression


1. Classification Class:                                      2.Regression class
-> here we have only categorial cases 				-> here we predict the real value
-> we sort the items into the categories 			-> we have to predict the real numbers or continuous classes
-> eg: if we want to sort the children as male or female.	->eg: predicting the age of people

ii) Supervised learning algorithms::
-> linear regression
-> logistic regression
-> support vector machines
-> decision trees 



2) Unsupervised learning::
->the model is trained only with the inputs, no output is given 
->the input data undergoes an algorithm after the interpration where the data is collected untrained 

i) types of unsupervised learning::
1.Clustering 
2.Association

1.Clustering class:
-> Discover groups 
2.Association class:
->Discover rules

ii) Unsupervised learning algorithms::
-> K-means clustering
-> principal component analysis
-> apriori algorithm
->hierarchical clustering 



3)Reinforcement learning::
->this learning agents are goal-oriented
->they learn by trial and error method 
->this should be given by penalties and rewards
->the agent is also called the model,the environment is the state and the goal is the output
->the main aim is to find the best path or way that maximizes the winning reward


i)Types of reinforcement learning:
1. Positive reinforecement 
2. Negative reinforcdment

1.Positive reinforcement:
->the stimulus is added to increase the livelihood of the behavior of the model

2.Negative reinforcement:
->the stimulus is removed to increase the livelihood of the behavior of the model 


ii)Reinforcement learning algorithms:
-> Monte carlo
-> q-learning
-> deep q network 
-> q-lambda
-> sarsa-lambda
